# BEU Results Fetcher

Small Python script to fetch student result payloads from BEU and save each payload as JSON and a combined CSV summary.

Files added
- `fetch_results.py` - main script. Uses `requests` and `ThreadPoolExecutor` to fetch results in parallel.
- `requirements.txt` - lists `requests`.

Usage

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script for a range of register numbers (example):

```bash
python3 fetch_results.py --start 23105108001 --end 23105108060 --concurrency 12
```

Default output directory is `./results_json`. Each successful payload is saved as `{redg_no}_{name}.json`. A CSV summary `results.csv` is written into that folder.

Notes
- The script uses a common browser-like User-Agent and Referer header. If the remote server requires a cookie or other headers, you can modify `HEADERS` in `fetch_results.py`.
- Be respectful of the remote server: choose a reasonable concurrency and avoid hammering the endpoint.

Using uv

This repository is now a `uv`-compatible project (see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). You can use `uv` to create an isolated environment and run the script with the declared dependencies.

1) Install `uv` (see uv docs). On macOS/Linux you can use the installer:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2) Create a venv (optional) and sync dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
uv venv
uv sync
```

3) Run the fetcher using uv (the project dependencies will be installed automatically when you run):

```bash
uv run python fetch_results.py -- --start 23105108001 --end 23105108060 --concurrency 12
```

Notes on the command:
- The `--` after `fetch_results.py` separates `uv` options from the script arguments in some shells. If you prefer, you can also run `uv run -- python fetch_results.py --start ...`.
- Alternatively, to run the script without the project environment, you can use `uv run --no-project --with requests fetch_results.py -- --start ...`.

If you want the script to be runnable directly with `uv run --script`, I can add inline script metadata at the top of `fetch_results.py` (depends vs project behavior). Let me know which behavior you prefer.
